# To-do

- Sliding with balanced combined groups
    - 16
    - 32
    - 64
- Summary of the output JSONs
- Questions
    - trade-off between more context and more chips
        - how does this play overall
        - how does this play by class
- Notebook with results



----

- Having more data but dirtier is not better
- options 
    - challenges of AI and open data
    - what we can learn about signatures from these experiments
    
- combine both John's and Mosaic
- train on Mosaic and re-train on John's
- use John's to enrich the small classes
- work with rather than predicted label probabilities
    - predict a final class using the probablities using another (spatial) model
- alternative parallel pipelines
- sample chips with probabilites of signature classes it covers

- we should think about what a success looks like
